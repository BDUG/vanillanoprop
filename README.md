# vanillanoprop

This here is a vanilla implementation of [NoProp](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.24322v2) according to *Qinyu Li*.
It is part of a baremetal AI framework, not requering exhausting 3rd party libraries, compare *Cargo.toml*. 

Call 
```
./run.sh
```
to see the continously evolving command line parameters. 

For example:
```
./run.sh train-noprop cnn
./run.sh predict
```
